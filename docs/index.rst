Introduction
============

Cartridge is a shopping cart application built using the Django framework. Its primary focus is to provide you with a clean and simple base for developing e-commerce websites. It purposely does not include every conceivable feature an e-commerce website could potentially use, instead focusing on providing only the core features that are common to every e-commerce website. 

This specific focus stems from the idea that every e-commerce website is different, tailoring to the particular business and products at hand, and should therefore be as easy as possible to customize. Cartridge achieves this goal with a code-base that implements only the core features of an e-commerce site, therefore remaining as simple as possible.

Given the outline above, this document focuses on the technical architecture of Cartridge with the aim of giving you enough of an overall understanding to implement and customize it for your own e-commerce websites.
